## Contribute to the FIT Resources Page

THe FIT Resources page is built [using the Github Pages plug in for Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll). Specifically, it uses [minimal mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) as a [remote theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes#remote-theme-method).

Note that the GitHub pages plug in requires a [specific version of Jekyll](https://pages.github.com/versions/) that is not the latest. [Learn more about the GitHub pages plug in](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/making-github-pages-work-with-latest-jekyll/).

### How to add a post 

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this NOAA FIT [resources repo](https://github.com/noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox/resources)
2. Create a blog post [markdown file](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and add it to the [posts folder](https://github.com/noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox/resources/tree/master/_posts) in your forked repo
3. Label the `.md` file `YYYY-MM-DD-post-name.md`
4. Create a header and add a category and tags (to search by). Here's an example header: 

```
---
title: "Contributing to R tools in the Toolbox"
excerpt: "R tools"
date: 2021-06-11
toc: true
categories:
  - NOAA FIT
tags:
  - R
  - NOAA resources
---
```

For the categories and tags available for use, please see the lists at https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/resources/categories and https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/resources/tags. Note that the case
needs to be matched. Please also avoid adding new tags or categories, unless there really isn't a similar tag in the list already and adding the new tag would help users find it.
Only 1 category should be included for a post, but unlimited tags can be added.

> See [contributing.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox/resources/master/_posts/2021-06-11-contributing.md) for an example of the `.md` file code.
5. Once a post is created in the post folder, build the site locally using github codespaces (instructions below).
6. [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) so we can merge the changes and update the FIT site.

### Build the site locally using GitHub codespaces.

1. Open a codespace from this repo.
2. In the terminal run `bundle update`
3. Finally run `bundle exec jekyll serve`. This can be viewed using the "Ports" tab.

Changes can then be made and the website will be updated as they are made.

Note: don't save any new files under the "_site" directory.

### Updating dependencies
Locally, run `bundle update` and commit changes to the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock.

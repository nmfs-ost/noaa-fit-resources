## What is a software badge?

Software badges are used to communicate key metrics or qualities about software. They are typically placed toward the top of the readme file on a software project's repository. They can also be used in other places. On the NOAA Fisheries Integrated Toolbox, software badges are included on a tool's webpage.

## How can I use software badges for my coding project?

Software badges can be placed at the top of your own coding projects! While badges look official, due to badge creation frameworks like [shields.io](https://shields.io/), a developer can actually put any text they would like onto a badge to help communicate a key quality about the software to users.

Check out the [shields.io badging documentation](https://shields.io/badges) for information on how to make your own badges. Copy and paste the markdown examples into your GitHub repository to use the badges!

Below are some selected examples of specific types of badges that could be helpful.

### GitHub Actions Badges

It is possible to [display a badge indicating the status](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/monitoring-workflows/adding-a-workflow-status-badge) of a GitHub action workflow.

### Code Coverage Badge

For R packages, a GitHub Actions workflow can be used to [calculate code coverage and create a display badge](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/ghactions4r/reference/use_create_cov_badge.html). Code coverage indicates what percentage of your code is run in automated tests, and is a simple metric of amount of testing.

### Lifecycle Badges

For R packages, the [lifecycle package](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/) provides information on using conventions, including badges, to signal to uses what state an R package or its functions are in.

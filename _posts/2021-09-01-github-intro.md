GitHub offers Git server as a service to track changes you make to your code, so you can always go back and view a history of changes you've made. In addition, there is a suite of project management and collaboration tools that help facilitate working that revolves around a codebase.

See information on [NOAA GitHub Guidelines](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/noaa-fit-resources/noaa%20resources/github-account/) to learn about using GitHub as a NOAA Fisheries Affiliate.

### GitHub can help you stay organized

[Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-repositories) are like directories for your code or project, but are under **[Version control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)**. This helps you keep code changes in one place and tracks differences so you can go back to older versions as needed!

Repositories can be **public**, if you want others to see your code or to collaborate, or **[private](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility)**, if you want to use Git and GitHub functionality without sharing your code. 

GitHub also helps you stay organized through project managment tools like Projects.

## GitHub helps you collaborate

GitHub helps you share code more readily. People can see your code and copy it directly to their computer by downloading a `.zip` file or by [cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) your repository. 

People can also [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) your repository to have their own repository on GitHub that keeps up with changes to the your repo. On their fork, they can make changes, and then open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to suggest changes to your codebase.

You can [‘add collaborators’](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/repository-access-and-collaboration/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) to a repository so multiple people can work on it at the same time.

## GitHub Vocabulary

[**Repositories**](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-repositories) (or 'repos') contain all of your project's files and each file's revision history

[**Clone**](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) a repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between two locations 

[**Fork**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) a repository to make a copy and freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project

[**Branches**](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) can be used to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository

[**Push**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) commits made on your local branch to a remote repository

[**Pull / Pull request**](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository

[**Commit**](https://docs.github.com/en/github/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits) records changes to one or more files in your branch

## GitHub Video Tutorial

This video tutorial provides an introduction to using Git and GitHub. Follow along with the corresponding tutorial [here](https://github.com/aomlomics/tutorials). This webinar is presented by Luke Thompson, an Associate Research Professor at the Northern Gulf Institute at Mississippi State University & Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML). The webinar was hosted by the [NOAA Central Library](https://library.noaa.gov/).

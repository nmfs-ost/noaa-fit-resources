## Why should you use GitHub? 

### Personal Use

#### Organization

[Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-repositories) or 'repos' are like directories for your code or project 
- Can be public
  - Code you might want other people to see, to be able to share code / [collaborate]()
- Or private 
  - Example: can keep everything from a manuscript you’re writing in a repo

#### [Version control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) - tracks changes you make to your code 

GitHub will track all the changes you make, and you can go back and view these changes 
- Many ‘workflows’ for setting this up this 

### Collaboration

#### Share code

People can see your code and copy it 
- Copy it directly to their computer by downloading a `.zip` file or [‘cloning’](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository)
- You can also ‘fork’ a repository to have your own repository on GitHub that keeps up with changes to the owners repo (see more about forking below) 

Get input from others 
- People can [‘fork’](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) a repository, make changes, and then open a [‘pull request’](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
  - Essentially you are ‘suggesting a change’ to the code, website, etc. 

Collaborate directly 
- You can [‘add collaborators’](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) to a repository so multiple people can work on it at the same time and you can directly make changes and see who made changes - again, version control tracks all of these changes

## GitHub Vocab 

[**Repositories**](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-repositories) contain all of your project's files and each file's revision history

[**Clone**](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) a repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between two locations 

[**Fork**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) a repository to make a copy and freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project

[**Branches**](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) can be used to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository

[**Push**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) commits made on your local branch to a remote repository

[**Pull / Pull request**](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository

[**Commit**](https://docs.github.com/en/github/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits) records changes to one or more files in your branch

## GitHub Video Tutorial

This video tutorial provides an intro to using Git and GitHub. Follow along with the corresponding tutorial [here](https://github.com/aomlomics/tutorials). This webinar is presented by Luke Thompson, an Associate Research Professor at the Northern Gulf Institute at Mississippi State University & Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML). The webinar was hosted by the [NOAA Central Library](https://library.noaa.gov/).

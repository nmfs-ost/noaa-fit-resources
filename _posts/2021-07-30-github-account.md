[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a great way to share code and work collaboratively. 

For a best practices guide for using GitHub within NOAA Fisheries, see the [nmfs-opensci GitHub Guide](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/GitHub-Guide/).

See the [NOAA Fisheries GitHub Governance Team Website](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/nmfs-st-github-governance-team) (website available for NOAA internal users who are logged into their noaa.gov email) for more information on using GitHub within NOAA.

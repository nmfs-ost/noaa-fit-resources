Would you like to share about the FIT with others? We have shared media that you can use to promote or explain the FIT! Currently available media includes:

- A [single slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19NT4qXHeDk7QEgkVUAfWy6jgyXIRuU91TQtIUNJMO_4/edit?usp=drive_link) (2 options) to introduce the FIT, perhaps in your own presentation on your tool included in the FIT (NOAA internal only).
- A [5 minute presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LQPRLXiKlNfriNo6WAEoNzTSMq3PLenQlFuXlNlxgbc/edit?usp=drive_link) that briefly introduces the FIT (NOAA internal only).
- A [15 minute presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XbowlSuhfavGPKylrHstZF1EwT8pntXwnF_GwQlWoKE/edit?usp=sharing) that thoroughly introduces the FIT and why it matters to open science (NOAA internal only). A recorded version of this presentation is available upon request.
- The [FIT logos](https://github.com/noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox/FIT_graphics/tree/main/FIT_logo) can be used in presentations, for example when sharing a software tool that is part of the FIT.

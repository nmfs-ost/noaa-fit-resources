## What is the FIT R Universe?

The [FIT R Universe](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.r-universe.dev/packages) provides access to the latest compiled R packages in the FIT. These packages are built from the default branch of R code repositories in the FIT. Install is fast and easy (like installing from CRAN), with instructions on each R package's R universe page. There is also documentation available on each R package.

## What does the FIT R Universe provide for developers?

The FIT R universe can provide value to developers by:

- Showing successful and failed builds of their R package on the [builds page](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.r-universe.dev/builds)
- Providing an easier install experience for users, hopefully saving developers from having to troubleshoot users' install issues
- [Automatic hosting vignettes](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.r-universe.dev/articles) included in the R package
- Providing snapshots of binaries on the [API page](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.r-universe.dev/apis), which can be attached to GitHub Releases

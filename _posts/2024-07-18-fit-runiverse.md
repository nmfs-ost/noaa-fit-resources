## What is the FIT R Universe?

The [FIT R Universe](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.r-universe.dev/packages) provides access to the latest compiled R packages in the FIT. These packages are built from the default branch of R code repositories in the FIT. Install is fast and easy (like installing from CRAN), with instructions on each R package's R universe page. There is also documentation available on each R package.

## What does the FIT R Universe offer for developers?

The FIT R universe can provide value to developers by:

- Passing and failed builds of their R package are visible on the [Builds page](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.r-universe.dev/builds)
- Providing easier install experience for users, hopefully saving developers from troubleshooting install issues
- [Vignettes are hosted](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.r-universe.dev/articles) with no additional set up for developers
- Ability to download a snapshot of binaries on the [API page](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.r-universe.dev/apis), which can be attached to GitHub Releases

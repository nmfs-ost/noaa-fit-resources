## What is the FIT R Universe?

The [FIT R Universe](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.r-universe.dev/packages) provides access to the latest compiled R packages in the FIT. These packages are built from the default branch of R code repositories in the FIT. Install is fast and easy (like installing from CRAN), with instructions on each R package's R universe page. There is also documentation available on each R package.

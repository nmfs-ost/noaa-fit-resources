# Review process overview

A reviewer from the FIT committee is assigned to review a FIT tool. The review is checklist-based, meaning that a reviewer will use the information provided by a tool maintainer to determine if a tool meets each checkbox on the tool quality checklist.

Before review begins, the FIT coordinator will fill out the [tool inclusion checklist](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/noaa-fit-resources/noaa%20fit/tool-quality-reviewer-checklists/#checklist-for-fit-coordinator). The FIT coordinator will then assign a reviewer to complete the [documentation](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/noaa-fit-resources/noaa%20fit/tool-quality-reviewer-checklists/#documentation) and [tests](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/noaa-fit-resources/noaa%20fit/tool-quality-reviewer-checklists/#tests) checklists.

# Reviewer conflict of interest

The FIT coordinator or reviewer has a conflict of interest if any of the following apply:

1. They are a co-developer of the tool
2. They supervise or are supervised by a co-author of the tool
3. They feel that they cannot review the tool in an unbiased way

If there is a conflict of interest, they should recuse themselves from tool review, and a replacement reviewer will be found. If there is a conflict of interest for the FIT coordinator, then a back-up coordinator, a drawer lead, or other member of the FIT committee will review the tool inclusion checklist instead.

Note that federal employees are subject to [federal ethics rules](https://2010-2014.commerce.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2015/january/noaa-summary_of_ethics_rules-2015_0.pdf), which include [conflicts of interest due to personal relationships](https://2010-2014.commerce.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2015/january/appearance_of_bias-awae-2015-e_0.pdf). Non-government peer reviewers of influential scientific information are subject to a [NOAA Conflict of Interest Policy](https://www.noaa.gov/organization/information-technology/policy-oversight/information-quality/noaa-conflict-of-interest-policy-for-non-government-peer-reviewers-of-influential-scientific).

# When do reviews take place?

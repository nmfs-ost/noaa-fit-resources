## Known issues

There are some [known issues](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vPFWBK8TrGjdXrrAlXhcq5f1B7Ap3ppnitnDIUMaS6g/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.hho3ab9880rl) for problems encountered by many NOAA staff with installing R packages from GitHub. Please feel free to try out the solutions listed and make suggestions to improve the document! Hopefully, this can be a resource so less NOAA staff need to troubleshoot these common problems on their own.

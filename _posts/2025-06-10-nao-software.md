## What is NAO 201-118?

[NAO 201-118](https://www.noaa.gov/administration/nao-201-118-software-governance-and-public-release-policy) (hereafter "the NAO") defines software licensing, quality assurance, and documentation requirements, and promotes compliance with laws and best practices for software public release. A handbook with more specific guidance is forthcoming at the time of this post.

Developers are encouraged to read through the NAO to ensure that their software development practices comply with the NAO. At the time of this post, the NOAA Fisheries Line Office still needs to implement the NAO (as laid out in Section 8 of the NAO).

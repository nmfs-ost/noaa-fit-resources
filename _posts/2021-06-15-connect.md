The NOAA Fisheries Office of Science and Technology has a [Posit Connect instance](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/nmfs-connect) for use by anyone in NOAA Fisheries with a noaa.gov email. Request access through [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNODOiiAjFBQgoLJ50TJps_Xy85YaPlUxRiG6opLEFOQhQew/viewform?usp=sf_link).

In anticipation of this instance, the May 2021 Fisheries Integrated Toolbox Technical Meeting featured an RStudio (Rstudio is now known as Posit) Connect Demo for those planning to use it. The demo provides an overview of how NMFS scientists can use Connect for:
- Simple shiny app deployments
- Git backed publishing

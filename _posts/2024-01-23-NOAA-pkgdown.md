## How to create a NOAA themed pkgdown landing site for your tool

Below are the 4 steps for creating a NOAA themed pkgdown webpage, with NOAA colors and a NOAA logo footer, for your tool on the toolbox.

1. Set up a pkgdown website for your tool using the [pkgdown readme instructions](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/).
2. Create a pkgdown folder in your repository and add a file called `pkgdown/extra.css`. Add the code below to the `extra.css` file:
    ```
    @import url("https://nmfs-fish-tools.github.io/nmfspalette/extra.css");
    ```
This will allow the [CSS file with NMFS styling](https://nmfs-fish-tools.github.io/nmfspalette/extra.css) to be used for your pkgdown site. Optional: For those who wish to dive deeper, read an [overview on what CSS is](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS) to understand what the css file is doing.

3. If you don't have one already, add a [NOAA Disclaimer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nmfs-fish-tools/Resources/master/Disclaimer.md) to the footer of your README.md that will be automatically added to your pkgdown page.
 
    ```

4. Add the code below to your repository's README.md to add a footer.

    ```

## Automate your pkgdown rendering

Want your pkgdown site to always be up to date with your code? Use the [`use_update_pkgdown()`](https://nmfs-fish-tools.github.io/ghactions4r/reference/use_update_pkgdown.html) workflow from the [`{ghactions4r}` package](https://nmfs-fish-tools.github.io/ghactions4r/) to set up a GitHub Action that renders the pkgdown site automatically on changes to the main branch. Note that this workflow will deploy the pkgdown site to a branch called gh-pages, so the [publishing source for GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) will need be set to the root of the gh-pages branch. There is also a [`{usethis}` method](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_pkgdown.html) for automatically rendering your pkgdown site. The difference between the `{usethis}` approach and `{ghactions4r}` is that `{ghactions4r}` makes it so you only have to update the ghactions workflow once.

## Going further

Optional steps to improve your pkgdown page

### Adding a video tutoral to your landing page

Follow the instructions below to add a video demo or overview of your tool on your pkgdown landing page. Examples of this can be seen on the [wham](https://timjmiller.github.io/wham/) and [bayesdfa](https://fate-ewi.github.io/bayesdfa/) pages. 

### Embed a video in a `.md` page

Using a link from YouTube or Vimeo:
1. Click `share`
2. Click `embed link`
3. Copy and Paste the embed link into the `.md` file where you want the video to appear

Example code from YouTube embed link:
```
<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A7qDN2oYSxc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>
```

## Our mission

The NOAA Fisheries Integrated Toolbox (NOAA FIT) is designed to facilitate the availability of modeling and analysis tools across NOAA Fisheries to ensure that the best available science is used to support living marine resource management. The FIT curates open source tools that NOAA Fisheries scientists use and develop to support open science workflows for NOAA Fisheries research and operations. The FIT strives to meet FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for research software.

## Who is involved

The FIT is nothing without users and developers of software! The NOAA FIT is maintained by the [National Stock Assessment Program](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/population-assessments) in the [NOAA Fisheries Office of Science and Technology](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/office-science-and-technology) in collaboration with NOAA Fisheries researchers and developers across the line office. The FIT committee, consisting of representatives across science centers and disciplines, provides direction for the FIT.

## How do I list my software tool on the NOAA FIT website?

Please request onboarding by [opening an issue in the onboard-and-update repository](https://github.com/noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox/onboard-and-update/issues/new/choose).

 ## The metadata of my software on the NOAA FIT website is out of date. How do I update it?

Please request the metadata be updated by [opening an issue in the onboard-and-update repository](https://github.com/noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox/onboard-and-update/issues/new/choose).

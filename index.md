[The NOAA Fisheries Integrated Toolbox](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/) includes scientific tools and software applications developed with contributions from scientists and programmers at NOAA and at external organizations. Tools from individual groups (i.e., toolbox "drawers") are found under four organizations, with a fifth drawer that includes general modeling tools used across disciplines or for general analysis.

<ul class ="tools_list">
    <li style="background:rgba(10,69,149,0.4);" >Fish and Fisheries</li>
    <li style="background:rgba(10,69,149,.55);" >Protected Species</li>
    <li style="background:rgba(10,69,149,.7);" >Human Dimensions</li>
    <li style="background:rgba(10,69,149,.85);" >Ecosystems</li>
  <li style="background:#0a4595;" >General Modeling Tools</li>
</ul>

This Resources page provides resources associated with each drawer of the toolbox for users, as well as resources for developers of tools. To contribute to the toolbox, see [Contributing](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/resources/noaa%20fit/contributing/) and to include a tool in the toolbox see [Onboarding Procedures](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/resources/noaa%20fit/overview/).
